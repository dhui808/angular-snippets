### Exclamation mark ! operator
    Non-null assertion operator. It is a way to tell the compiler "this expression cannot be null or 
    undefined here, so don't complain about the possibility of it being null or undefined."
    @Input() loading?: boolean;
          
### Question mark ? operator
    To mark the parameter as optional.
    @Input() todo!: Todo;
